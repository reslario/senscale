# senscale
Scales your mouse sensitivity on a per-process basis.

## Requirements
The [RawAccel](https://github.com/a1xd/rawaccel) driver must be installed.

Note: This software only runs on Windows.

## Configuration
A default configuration file will be generated the first time the program is run, after which it can be found at ``C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\reslario\senscale\config\config.toml``.

## Limitations
As senscale uses the RawAccel drivers, there is always a one second delay when changing the mouse sensitivity.
